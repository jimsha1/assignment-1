    <center><h2>PLOTTER</h2></center>
    <p>
        A graphics printer that draws images with ink pens. Plotters actually draw point-to-point lines directly from vector graphics files. The plotter was the first computer output device that could print graphics as well as accommodate full-size engineering and architectural drawings.
