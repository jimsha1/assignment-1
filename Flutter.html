    <center><h3>Flutter</h3></center>
    <p>
        The first version of Flutter was known as "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit[6] with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second.[7] During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai in September 2018, Google announced Flutter Release Preview 2, the last major release before Flutter 1.0. On December 4th of that year, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the first stable version of the framework. On December 11, 2019, Flutter 1.12 was released at the Flutter Interactive event.[8]

On May 6, 2020, the Dart software development kit (SDK) version 2.8 and Flutter 1.17.0 were released, adding support for the Metal API which improves performance on iOS devices by approximately 50%, as well as new Material widgets and network tracking development tools.

On March 3, 2021, Google released Flutter 2 during an online Flutter Engage event. This major update brought official support for web-based applications with a new CanvasKit renderer and web specific widgets, early-access desktop application support for Windows, macOS, and Linux and improved Add-to-App APIs.[9] This release also utilized Dart 2.0 that featured sound null-safety, which caused many breaking changes and issues with many external packages; however, the Flutter team included instructions and tools to mitigate these issues.[10]

On September 8th, 2021, Dart 2.14 and Flutter 2.5 were released by Google. The update brought improvements to the Android full-screen mode and the latest version of Google's Material Design called Material You. Dart received two new updates, standardizing lint conditions and marking support for Apple Silicon as stable.[11][12]
